                            <p> <span class="name-and-place">Iwatani Naofumi</span> Naofumi had initially been an exceedingly trusting and positive person. He was also enthusiastic about his situation when initially summoned. However, his mentality abruptly
                                changed after Malty S Melromarc, the princess of Melromarc, betrayed him. The Princess's betrayal has left him in an almost permanent state of anger and hostility, although he masks them behind a calm and level-headed personality.
                                This mentality bites him back as he unknowingly pushes away genuine believers of the Shield Hero and Siltvelt envoys. Due to Raphtalia and Filo, he becomes less inwardly hostile towards women but is still oblivious to their
                                advances. After Raphtalia renews her Slave Crest, when she asks him what he thinks of her body, exposed at the time for the application of the crest, he remains oblivious. At one point in time, he is somewhat amazed when
                                Beloukas is willing to pay 35 gold pieces for Raphtalia after she becomes a beauty as well. Eventually, he recovers more of his caring side and begins treating Raphtalia like a daughter rather than a slave.

    <h2>How did change my life</h2>

    <p class='p9'>He hasn't really changed my life, but he taught me that even if we are lower than the earth and everyone "is against you" not to give up. Anyway when we are not so low we have nothing more to lose so given time to go up the slope. Even if we miss
        these not necessarily the "Game over".
