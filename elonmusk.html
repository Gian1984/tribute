                <img class="img-circle" alt="3rd" src="templateimg/3rd.png">
                <p>Neuralink Corporation is an American neurotechnology company, developing implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces. Since its founding, the company has hired several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities. By July 2019, it had
                    received $158 million in funding (of which $100 million was from Musk) and was employing a staff of 90 employees. At that time, Neuralink announced that it was working on a "sewing machine-like" device capable of implanting very thin
                    threads into the brain, and demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1,500 electrodes. By August 2020, the Neuralink 1024-electrode read/write link device had been approved as a FDA breakthrough device which allows
                    it to be used in limited human testing under the FDA guidelines for testing medical devices.</p>
